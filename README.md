This website is a personal project that I created to celebrate my one year anniversary with my girlfriend. It's a simple, responsive website with a custom theme toggle, live countdown timer, and a parallax scrolling effect. The website also includes a section for memories, a section for celebration, and a section for gift exchange. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which means that it's accessible from the web. You can visit the website at https://wikiwoo.github.io/anniversary-website/.

To customize the website, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can also change the theme color and start date of the countdown timer. To do this, you'll need to edit the HTML file and change the CSS variables at the top of the file.

To add new sections, you can create new HTML files and add them to the index.html file. You can also add new CSS classes to the CSS file to style the new sections.

To add new functionality, you can modify the JavaScript file. You can add new animations, animation triggers, and event listeners to create a unique experience for your visitors.

I hope you enjoy exploring the website and celebrating your one year anniversary with your girlfriend. Happy celebration!

Best regards,
